# Fundamentals-of-Programming-Language

Difference between class & Interface:
 Class                                                         Interface
 consists of Concrete and abstract methods                   Interface consists of only abstract methods.
 Multiple Inheritance is not supported                       Supports Multiple Inheritance.
 A class can implement Interface                             Interface cannot implement another Interface
 Final, non-static, static variables are supported           Only final and static variables are supported
 class can inherit another class using extends keyword       Interface can implement another interface
 and use an implement for Interface
 Class can have any type of members - Public, private      Interface only Public
 Class can have constructor                                Interface cannot have a constructor
 
 
 Constructors is similar to functions
 Methods are used to have return types that calls the constructors.
 
 Constructors  is a kind of giving instructions to JVM to assign varaiables 
 Method - User defined functions to change the values based on business needs.
 Functions - a group which perform all the COnstructor and Method activity is called function
 
 Object - all the instances which is passed inside the class is an object.
 
 Method Override, Function Override - superclass methods & functions are overrided in another class.
